This class defines a structure to hold a qudrilateral spherical field. It
provides two different kinds of initializers. One giving a center 
coordinate and an extension angle. This angle is the solid angle 
of the field on a unit sphere.
The other initializer allows to specify the four corners.

Restriction: The current implementation is restricted to fields which 
are aligned with the longitude great circles.
